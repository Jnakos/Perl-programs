# Perl-programs
In this repo I present the work I did for lab assignments while attending the course "Bioinformatics" as an undergraduate student of biology. Whenever I get the chance I'll try to improve the code of these programs to be more ellegant, while learning more on perl code, so it's gonna be a work in progress. Feel free to recommend any sort of change if you feel like it.
